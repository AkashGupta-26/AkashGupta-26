## 🧠 About Me

Also known as Magnet, I'm a curious and driven learner with a deep passion for problem-solving, technology, and continuous growth. Whether it's crafting clever strategies on the chessboard, exploring new programming concepts, or tackling complex challenges, I thrive on opportunities that stretch my thinking. I enjoy diving into systems, understanding how things work, and finding innovative solutions—whether in code, logic, or real-world applications. I'm always looking to expand my skills, share knowledge, and collaborate with others who value curiosity, creativity, and impact.
